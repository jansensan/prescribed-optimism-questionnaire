## Context

In the context of the [Research Methodologies in Humanities and Science](https://academia.jansensan.net/category/30845/) course of the [Master in Cognitive Systems and Interactive Media](https://www.upf.edu/web/csim), we must attempt to prepare the replication of a research project chosen from the [Reproducibility Project](https://osf.io/ezcuj/) of the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/).

We have chosen _Prescribed Optimism — Is it right to be wrong about the future?_ originally conducted by [Armor, Massey & Sackett (2008)](https://ir.stthomas.edu/ocbmktgpub/27/), and later reproduced by [Lassetter, Brandt & van 't Veer (2016)](https://osf.io/qlzap/).

> We test the assumption that people desire to be accurate when making predictions about their own future. Results revealed that, across four different scenarios and three manipulated variables (commitment to a decision, agency over the decision, and control over outcomes), participants thought it was better to make optimistically biased predictions than accurate or pessimistically biased predictions. Additionally, participants thought that they and others would be optimistic in the scenarios they read, but insufficiently so. We argue that prescriptions can serve as one standard by which the quality of predictions can be judged, and that this particular standard strongly endorses optimism.
